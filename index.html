     <p class="second_section_p">CSS is important because it controls all design-related aspects of your website. Typography,
         colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of your website are all controlled by
          CSS and CSS sits on top of HTML's raw structure to dress it up and make everything look pretty.</p>

<p class="third_section_p">Padding is the inner space between the content and the border of your box that is it controls how 
    much breathing room exists within a box.</p>
<p class="third_section_p">Margin is the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box that is it controls how much
     breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a box.</p>
<p class="third_section_p">Border is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored
     line like the green one pictured above.</p>
